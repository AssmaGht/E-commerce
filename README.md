# E-Commerce Application

The E-Commerce Application is built using Java and Spring Boot, focusing on scalability and ease of maintenance. The backend uses Spring Data JPA to interact with a MySQL database, making it easy to manage and store important entities such as users, products, categories, orders, and more.  

The APIs are well-documented and easily accessible through Swagger UI, making it simple for developers to test and understand the various endpoints. Overall, this project provides REST APIs to create a scalable platform for businesses to sell their products to customers.
